This site was originally set up to describe a specific **information standard** used by  **bio.agents** [^1] - the Agents and Data Services Registry of the IECHOR [^4] research infrastructure.  A great deal has changed since then, and this site is being repurposed to cover a whole stack of information standards for the desription of bioinformatics software agents.  Of particular interest is new development called **Agent information profiles**.  These define lists of software attributes (from bioagentsCore) that can, should or must be specified for different types of agents within a set of agent descriptions. An individual profile - a JSON file conforming to agentInfoProfileSchema (JSON schema) - defines an **information requirements** that is tailored to an individual communities (national, scientific or technical).  Agent information profiles provide a practical **curation framework** and **metrics** for any corpus of agents. {[repo](http://github.com/bio-agents/agent-information-profile)}
