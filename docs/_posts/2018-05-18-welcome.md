Welcome!

This site describes an **information standard** for the desription of **bioinformatics software agents**. The standard specifies the attributes that must be defined within a 5-tier scale of software description completeness and quality.  It is based on bioagents schema [^1] - a formalised XML schema (XSD) which provides a rigorous **syntax** and controlled vocabularies for over 50 basic agent attributes - and the EDAM ontology [^2] which provides rigorous **semantics** for the scientific description of agents.

The standard is being adopted by **bio.agents** [^3] - the Agents and Data Services Registry of the IECHOR [^4] research infrastructure.

The standard has been defined by a **community-driven process**: everyone is encouraged to join the [discussion](https://github.com/bio-agents/Agent-Information-Standard/issues/1) and [contribute](https://github.com/bio-agents/Agent-Information-Standard).

For enquiries, please mail [Jon Ison](jon.c.ison@gmail.com).
