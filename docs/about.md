An **information standard** for the desription of bioinformatics software agents, that lists software attributes that must be specified within a 5-tier scale of description completeness and quality.  It is based on [bioagents schema](https://github.com/bio-agents/bioagents-schema) and the [EDAM ontology](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology). The standard is being adopted by [bio.agents](https://bio.agents) - the IECHOR Agents and Data Services Registry.

- [Broadly applicable to diverse types of agent](#agenttypes) including application software, workflows and APIs. 
- Uses software attributes defined in [bioagents schema](https://github.com/bio-agents/bioagents-schema).
- Makes heavy use of controlled vocabularies including the [EDAM ontology](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology) for types of data, data formats, operations and common topics.
- It is an [open community-driven project](#community).

The standard has been defined by a community-driven process: everyone is encouraged to join the [discussion](https://github.com/bio-agents/Agent-Information-Standard/issues/1) and [contribute](https://github.com/bio-agents/Agent-Information-Standard).
