introduction: |
  A stack of community-defined, open and integrated technologies, technical standards and guidelines:

  <p align="center"> <img src="https://bio-agents.github.io/Agent-Information-Standards/assets/images/technology_stack.png" /></p>

  - Comprehensive list of scientific, technical and administrative **software attributes** to support cataloguing, discovery, use and interoperability of software
  - A practical **description model** for bioinformatics software - bioagents schema - which reduces the complexity of bioinformatics software into collections of readily understandable functional units.
  - Precise **agent function descriptions** in terms of their operations, types of input and output data, data formats and common topics, using the [EDAM ontology](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology)
  - **Controlled vocabularies** for consistent descriptions of technical software aspects such as programming language and license.
  - Define flexible **information requirements** - which software attributes that can, should or must be specified for different types of agents within a set of agent descriptions - using agent information profiles. 
  - [Broadly applicable to diverse types of agent](#agenttypes) including application software, workflows and APIs. 
  - **User-friendly guidelines** on how attribute should be specified when describing software.
  - Built by an [open community](#community).
